![Me](/20141117_123012000_iOS.png)

I am a PhD student in the Classical Studies Graduate Program ([CLST](https://classicalstudies.columbia.edu/)) at Columbia University.
<!-- My advisor is [Prof. Sung-Hoon Kang](https://humanities.snu.ac.kr/en/faculty?deptidx=13&md=view&profidx=157). -->

My research area is ancient philosophy, with special interests in Plato and Aristotle. I also have general research interests in philosophy and classical studies: for the former, especially in metaphysics and logic; for the latter, especially in textual criticism.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Philosophy and a Master's degree in Western Philosophy, both degrees from Seoul National University. My Master's project was on the _Theaetetus_ of Plato, resulting in the thesis entitled "A Study on the Self-Refutation of Relativism in the _Theaetetus_ of Plato" (in Korean).
<!-- I am now working on the _Timeus_ of Plato. -->

You can find my CV [here](cv.pdf). You can contact me by email: <wk2377@columbia.edu>.

<!-- Ps. "\[A\]ubout" refers to *Voyage au bout de la nuit* by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, a quote from which opens the film *La Grande Bellezza* by Paolo Sorrentino:
>Voyager, c'est bien utile, ça fait travailler l'imagination. Tout le reste n'est que déception et fatigues. Notre voyage à nous est entièrement imaginaire. Voilà sa force. -->
