I am an incoming PhD student to the interdepartmental [Classical Studies Graduate Program](https://classicalstudies.columbia.edu/) (CLST) at Columbia University.
<!-- My advisor is [Prof. Sung-Hoon Kang](https://humanities.snu.ac.kr/en/faculty?deptidx=13&md=view&profidx=157). -->

My research focuses on ancient philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle. I also have research interests in logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Philosophy and a Master's degree in Western Philosophy, both degrees from Seoul National University. My Master's project was on the _Theaetetus_ of Plato, resulting in the thesis entitled "A Study on the Self-Refutation of Relativism in the _Theaetetus_ of Plato" (in Korean). I am now working on the _Timeus_ of Plato.

You can find my CV [here](cv.pdf). You can contact me by email: <wk2377@columbia.edu>.

>Voyager, c'est bien utile, ça fait travailler l'imagination. Tout le reste n'est que déception et fatigues. Notre voyage à nous est entièrement imaginaire. Voilà sa force. -->
