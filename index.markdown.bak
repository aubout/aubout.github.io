<span style="font-size:larger;">I am a PhD student at Seoul National University. My advisor is [Prof. Sung-Hoon Kang](https://humanities.snu.ac.kr/en/faculty?deptidx=13&md=view&profidx=157).</span>

<span style="font-size:larger;">My research focuses on ancient philosophy, especially Plato and Aristotle. I also have research interests in logic, epistemology, and metaphysics.</span>

<span style="font-size:larger;">I hold a Bachelor's degree in Economics and Philosophy and a Master's degree in Western Philosophy, both degrees from Seoul National University. My Master's project was on the _Theaetetus_ of Plato, resulting in the thesis titled "A Study on the Self-Refutation of Relativism in the _Theaetetus_ of Plato" (in Korean). I am now working on the _Timeus_ of Plato.</span>
