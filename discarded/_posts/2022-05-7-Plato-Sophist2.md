> ΞΕ. Τί δέ; τὸ θάτερον ἆρα ἡμῖν λεκτέον πέμπτον; ἤ
τοῦτο καὶ τὸ ὄν ὡς δύ' ἄττα ὀνόματα ἐφʼ ἑνὶ γένει διανοεῖσθαι δεῖ;
ΘΕΑΙ. Τάχʼ ἄν.
ΞΕ. Ἀλλ' οἶμαί σε συγχωρεῖν τῶν ὄντων τὰ μὲν αὐτὰ
καθʼ αὑτά, τὰ δὲ πρὸς ἄλλα ἀεὶ λὲγεσθαι
ΘΕΑΙ. Τί δʼ οὔ;
ΞΕ. Τὸ δέ γʼ ἕτερον ἀεὶ πρὸς ἕτερον· ἦ γάρ;
ΘΕΑΙ. Οὕτως.
ΞΕ. Οὐκ ἄν, εἴ γε τὸ ὄν καὶ τὸ θάτερον μὴ πάμπολυ
διεφερέτην• ἀλλ' εἴπερ θάτερον ἀμφοῖν μετεῖχε τοῖν εἰδοῖν
ὥσπερ τὸ ὄν, ἦν ἄν ποτέ τι καὶ τῶν ἑτέρων ἕτερον οὐ πρὸς
ἕτερον νῦν δὲ ἀτεχρῶς ἡμῖν ὅτιπερ ἄν ἕτερον ᾖ, συμβέβηκεν ἐξ ἀράγκης ἑτέρου τοῦτο ὅπερ ἐστὶν εἶναι.
ΘΕΑΙ. Λέγεις καθάπερ ἔχει.
ΞΕ. Πέμπτον δὴ τὴν θατέρου φύσιν λεκτέον ἐν τοῖς
εἴδεσιν οὖσαν οἷς προαιρούμεθα.
ΘΕΑΙ. Ναί (Pl. *Sph.* 255cc9--e2).

Much is debated on how to properly understand the argument of the Stranger. Nothing is clear but the fact that the Stranger argues for the fourth member of the Greatest Kinds: (1) What does it mean that being partakes of the two forms? (2) The Stranger's argumenteation for the Different looks quite different from that of the Same, which raises the question, why does the Stranger change his argumentatation?

Let us first look into (2). It can be divided into two points: (2-1) What if one uses the same argumentation also for the Different? (2-2) What if one has used the same argumentation as that of the Different for the Same? These lead us to the following notorious passage:

> Ἀλλʼ εἰ τὸ ὄν καὶ τὸ ταὐτὸν μηδὲν διάφορον
σημαίνετον, κίρησιν αὖ πάλιν καὶ στάσιν ἀμφότερα εἶναι
λέγοντες ἀμφότερα οὕτως αὐτὰ ταὐτὸν ὡς ὄντα προσεροῦμεν (Pl. *Sph.* 255b11--c2).

At first sight, this argument suffers from a sever, but manifest, mistake. For, what prevents us, when we say motion and rest are the same, from meaning that motion and rest each are the same with itself? And what makes us only mean that motion and rest are the same with each other?

To relieve the issue, we need to take into account its dialecital context, that Theaetetus has implicitely agreed with the Stranger to use quite a revisionist language:[^1] saying that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the same commits one to the claim that \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are the same *with each other*, and nothing else. 

This makes the argument *ad hominem*. But is it harmful enough to make the Stranger commit himself to an informal logical error? For the Stranger does not aim at refuting Theaetetus. Thus, he does not fall into prey of begging the question (*petitio principii*). That said, this at the least should be clear, regardless of their agreement on the language use: the Stranger and Theaetetus postulate the sameness relation to be symmetrical. When \\(S\\) denotes the sameness relation,

\\[aSb \equiv bSa.\\]

An implication of the above reading is this: "\\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (both) are" should be distinguished from predicating "\\(b\\)" or \\(a\\) of \\(a\\) or \\(b\\), respectively.

[^1]: But see *Plt.* 259b7: "Καὶ μὴν οἰκονόμος γε καὶ δεσπότης ταὐτόν."
