>καὶ πρῶτον περὶ ἀνδρείας. Ὅτι μὲν οὖν μεσότης ἐστὶ περὶ
φόβους καὶ θάρρη, ἤδη φανερὸν γεγένηται· φοβούμεθα
δὲ δῆλον ὅτι τὰ φοβερά, ταῦτα δ᾽ ἐστὶν ὡς ἁπλῶς εἰπεῖν
κακά· διὸ καὶ τὸν φόβον ὁρίζονται προσδοκίαν κακοῦ (Arist. *EN* 3.6, 1115a6--9).

Aristotle defines courage (ἀνδρεία) as a median (μεσότης) regarding fearing *and* being bold. And fearing seems to be defined as an expectation of a bad thing, with one proviso: not all bad things matter to the courageous. Aristotle, however, does not say much about this proviso; rather, he gives an exemplar case: it is when faced with the fear of death in its most dangerous and noblest circumstances, that is, deaths in war, when one is to be judged courageous or not.
Anyway, courage concerns fearing and being bold, the former of which he says something. He gives no account of the latter, however. What is it then for someone to be bold for Aristotle?

See the following:
>περὶ μὲν οὖν φόβους καὶ θάρρη ἀνδρεία μεσότης· τῶν δ᾽ ὑπερβαλλόντων ὁ μὲν τῇ ἀφοβίᾳ ἀνώνυμος
(πολλὰ δ᾽ ἐστὶν ἀνώνυμα), ὁ δ᾽ ἐν τῷ θαρρεῖν ὑπερβάλλων θρασύς, ὁ δ᾽ ἐν τῷ μὲν φοβεῖσθαι ὑπερβάλλων τῷ δὲ
θαρρεῖν ἐλλείπων δειλός (Arist. *EN* 2.7, 1107a33--b4).

Let us take "excess in no fear" as another way of saying "falling short of fear." Then, the first thing to note is that Aristotle pins down the term "coward" as meaning, on the one hand, excess in fearing and falling short of being bold, on the other. But it is not plausible to suppose that Aristotle takes them to be the same, given that the state of being excess in being bold and that of falling short of fear are distinguished. Thus, Aristotle seems to use the term ambiguously, by giving the same name to two different states.

To relieve the situation, one may cite a passage from the *Rhetoric*:

>τό τε γὰρ θάρσος τὸ ἐναντίον τῷ
〈φόβῳ, καὶ τὸ θαρραλέον τῷ〉φοβερῷ, ὥστε μετὰ φαντασίας ἡ
ἐλπὶς τῶν σωτηρίων ὡς ἐγγὺς ὄντων, τῶν δὲ φοβερῶν 〈ὡς〉 ἢ
μὴ ὄντων ἢ πόρρω ὄντων (Arist. *Rh.* 2.5, 1383a16--19; Ross' OCT edition).

Based upon this, Taylor () argues that boldness is for Aristotle a positive assessment of the danger envisaged, while fearfulness is its negative counterpart regarding the same danger. But it would be safe to confine our attention to the *Nicomachean Ethics*, where I think a clue can be found:
