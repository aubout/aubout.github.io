Regarding someone who has virtue in mixing (ὁμιλία) with others, Aristotle says:

> διαφερόντως δ᾽ ὁμιλήσει τοῖς ἐν ἀξιώμασι καὶ τοῖς τυχοῦσι,
καὶ μᾶλλον ἢ ἧττον γνωρίμοις, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ κατὰ τὰς
ἄλλας διαφοράς, ἑκάστοις ἀπονέμων τὸ πρέπον, καὶ καθ'
αὑτὸ μὲν αἱρούμενος τὸ συνηδύνειν, λυπεῖν δ᾽ εὐλαβούμενος,
τοῖς δ᾽ ἀποβαίνουσιν, ἐὰν ᾖ μείζω, συνεπόμενος, λέγω δὲ
τῷ καλῷ καὶ τῷ συμφέροντι. καὶ ἡδονῆς δ᾽ ἕνεκα τῆς
εἰσαῦθις μεγάλης μικρὰ λυπήσει (Arist. *EN* 4.6, 1126b8--1127a6).

Aristotle may have in mind a case in which those who have virtue in mixing with others give bitter advice to less virtuous ones. What then makes that virtuous one (\\(\alpha_1\\)) different from a friendly one, or a friend (\\(\alpha_2\\))? For this virtuous disposition (ἕξις) appears to be most similar to that of friendship (Arist. *EN* 4.6, 1126b20). Answering it, we could say that \\(\alpha_1\\) will leave, if \\(\beta\\) rejects her advice, while \\(\alpha_2\\) would be still with \\(\beta\\), trying to persuade her friend.
