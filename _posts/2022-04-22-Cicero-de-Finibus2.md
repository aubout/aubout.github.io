>Ex quo illud efficitur, qui bene cenent omnis libenter cenare, qui libenter, non continuo bene. Semper Laelius bene (Cic. *de Fin.* 2.24--25).

"Continuo" could mean necessarily or in consequence (*OLD*, _s.v._ continuo 2). But it seems that "[s]emper" in the following resonates with "continuo." Then, if "continuo" were to be read as meaning necessarily, "semper" (always) should also mean necessarily, or at least should have some logical force, which is hard to find when consulting dictionaries. Thus, the plausible reading of "continuo" would be taking it as meaning without intermission or continuously (*OLD*, _s.v._ continuo 3).
