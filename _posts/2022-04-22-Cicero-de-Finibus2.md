>Ex quo illud efficitur, qui bene cenent omnis libenter cenare, qui libenter, non continuo bene. Semper Laelius bene (Cic. *de Fin.* 2.24--25).

"Continuo" could mean necessarily or in consequence (*OLD* _s.v._ continuo 2). But it seems that "[s]emper" in the following sentence resonates with "continuo" in the preceding sentence. Then, if "continuo" were to be read as meaning necessarily, "semper" (always) should mean necessarily either, or at least it should have some logical force, which is hard to find when consulting dictionaries. Thus, the plausible reading of "continuo" should be to take it as meaning without intermission or continuously (*OLD* _s.v._ continuo 3), it seems.
