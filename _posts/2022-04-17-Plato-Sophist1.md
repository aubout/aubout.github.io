>ΞΕ. Μέγιστα μὴν τῶν γενῶν ἅ νυνδὴ διῇμεν τό τε ὂν
αὐτὸ κὰ στάσις καὶ κίνησις.
ΘΕΑΙ. Πολύ γε.
ΞΕ. Καὶ μὴν τώ γε δύο φαμὲν αὐτοῖν ἀμείκτω πρὸς

The Stranger counts three greatest kinds, motion, rest, and being, on the ground that being (τὸ ὄν) can be combined both with motion and rest; motion and rest *both are*. Not enough attention is given, it seems, to the fact that Socrates says not that motion is *and* rest is; rather, he says they *both are* (ἐστὸν ἄμφω). Thus being here cannot mean something proper to either of them; for being is said to be common to both of them. What then is this common being? And what implication does it have in Platonic epistemology?

In the *Theaetetus*, it is agreed between Socrates and Theaetetus that knowledge is of being. And Socrates refutes Theaetetus, who has suggested knowledge is nothing else than perception (), by arguing that perception cannot be of being (). In his argument, Socrates relies upon a special feature of being, that it is common to everything; that is, he focuses on the common being of some thing*s*, as the Stranger in the *Sophist* does, not the proper being of something.

But see the following passage from the *Republic*:

One suggestion might be to construe the common being as the property of having essence. For the property of having essence is thought to be common, under certain metaphysical views, to everything. But, first,
