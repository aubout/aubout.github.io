>ΞΕ. Μέγιστα μὴν τῶν γενῶν ἅ νυνδὴ διῇμεν τό τε ὂν
αὐτὸ κὰ στάσις καὶ κίνησις.
ΘΕΑΙ. Πολύ γε.
ΞΕ. Καὶ μὴν τώ γε δύο φαμὲν αὐτοῖν ἀμείκτω πρὸς
ἀλλήλω.
ΘΕΑΙ. Σφόδρα γε.
ΞΕ. Τὸ δέ γε ὂν μεικτὸν ἀμφοῖν--ἐστὸν γὰρ ἄμφω που.
ΘΕΑΙ. Πῶς δʼ οὔ;
ΞΕ. Τρία δὴ γίγνεται ταῦτα.
ΘΕΑΙ. Τί μήν;
ΞΕ. Οὐκοῦν αὐτῶν ἕκαστον τοῖν μὲν δνοῖν ἕτερόν ἐστιν,
αὐτὸ δʼ ἑαντῷ ταὐτόν.
ΘΕΑΙ. Οὕτως (Pl. *Sph.* 254d4--e1).

Socrates counts greatest kinds motion, rest, and being as three, on the ground that being (τὸ ὂν) can be combined both with motion and rest; motion and rest *both are*. Not enough attention is given, it seems, to the fact that Socrates says not that motion is *and* rest is; rather, he says they *both are* (ἐστὸν ἄμφω). Thus being here cannot mean something proper to either of them; for being is said to be common to both of them. What then is this common being?
