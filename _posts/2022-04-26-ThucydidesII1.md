> διαφερόντως γὰρ δὴ καὶ τόδε ἔχομεν ὥστε τολμᾶν τε οἱ αὐτοὶ μάλιστα καὶ περὶ ὧν ἐπιχειρήσομεν ἐκλογίζεσθαι· [...] (Thuc. 2.40.3).

How to understand "οἱ αὐτοί"? For the clause where it is found must be *accusativus cum infinitivo* that follows "ὥστε." But the expressed subject of the infinitives "τολμᾶν" and "ἐκλογίζεσθαι" is "οἱ αὐτοὶ," which raises the question. It is not to be read as *nominativus cum infinitivo,* because even if the subject of an infinitive is the same as that of the governing verb, the emphatic use requires it to be expressed in the accusative case (cf. Smyth 1974). Thus, the only viable way to construe it seems to be taking it as predicative of the subject both of the governing verb and the infinitives (cf. Smyth 1973).[^1]
